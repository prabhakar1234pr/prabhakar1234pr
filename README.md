# 🤖 AI Engineer | Building Production-Ready AI Systems

> **Full-stack AI/ML engineer** specializing in RAG pipelines, LLM orchestration, and production ML systems. Currently pursuing M.S. in Informatics at Northeastern University.

## 🚀 What I Build

I architect and deploy **production AI systems** that solve real-world problems:

- **RAG-Powered Chatbots** - Built enterprise chatbot for IBM X Northeastern using watsonx + Milvus, serving 100+ students with sub-3s response times
- **AI-Powered Learning Platforms** - GitGuide: Transform GitHub repos into personalized learning journeys with Azure OpenAI
- **MLOps Pipelines** - Song popularity predictor processing 600K+ tracks with ZenML, MLflow, achieving R² ≈ 0.51
- **LLM Orchestration** - Multi-agent systems with LangChain/LangGraph, tool calling, and semantic search
- **Job Search AI** - MCP server for Claude Desktop with AI-powered resume tailoring across multiple platforms
